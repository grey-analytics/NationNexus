# National Cybersecurity Risk Index (NCRI)

## Overview

The National Cybersecurity Risk Index (NCRI) is a consolidated metric aimed at providing an overarching view of the cybersecurity posture of nations. This index has been crafted by aggregating multiple pre-existing cybersecurity indices from renowned global institutions. By averaging these scores, the NCRI offers stakeholders a unified and comprehensive measure of a nation's cybersecurity risk.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: We've gathered data from various recognized cybersecurity indices. Each source provides insights into specific facets of national cybersecurity, from infrastructure resilience to policy robustness.
2. **Normalization**: Scores from different indices often operate on different scales. We've normalized these scores to ensure comparability.
3. **Averaging**: The normalized scores are averaged to produce the NCRI for each country. This average provides a holistic view, reducing the biases of individual indices.
4. **Regular Updates**: As global cybersecurity landscapes evolve, so do the individual indices. We regularly update the NCRI to reflect these changes, ensuring its continued relevance.

## Why NCRI?

While each individual cybersecurity index provides invaluable insights, they often cater to specific niches or perspectives. The NCRI's strength lies in its consolidation of these diverse viewpoints, resulting in a balanced and comprehensive assessment. Whether you're a policymaker, a business leader, or a cybersecurity professional, the NCRI offers a straightforward measure to gauge and compare national cybersecurity risks.
